    "The error message `Invalid magic number` is not due to a flaw in the VM implementation. Instead, it is likely caused by an endianness issue. The magic number is written by the compiler (`covicc`) in a fixed byte order (big-endian), but when the VM reads it into a native `uint32_t` on a little-endian machine, the byte order is reversed. This causes the comparison with the expected magic number (defined as `0xFAACBEED`) to fail.\n",

    "\n",
    "The issue is more likely due to a mismatch in byte ordering between the way the magic number is written by the compiler (`covicc`) and how it is expected by the VM. This is especially important on little-endian systems. \n",

    "Double-check that the compiler writes the magic number in the native endianness of your system or adjust the VM's reading logic accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
